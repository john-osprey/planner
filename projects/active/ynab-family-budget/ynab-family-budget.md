# YNAB Family Budget Project

**Status**: Active
**Start Date**: 2025-11-30
**Priority**: High
**Project Type**: Financial management, family budget planning
**Tool**: YNAB (You Need A Budget)

## Project Overview

Restart using YNAB (You Need A Budget) to create and maintain a balanced family budget. Establish clear spending categories, track all income and expenses, eliminate budget drift, and ensure financial goals are met while maintaining family financial health.

## Core Objectives

1. **Reactivate YNAB**: Get YNAB account current and functional
2. **Complete Setup**: Establish all accounts, categories, and budget structure
3. **Zero-Based Budgeting**: Give every dollar a job using YNAB methodology
4. **Regular Reconciliation**: Keep budget current and accurate
5. **Family Alignment**: Get Katie on board with budget and tracking
6. **Achieve Balance**: Spend less than earned, build savings
7. **Financial Clarity**: Always know where money is going

## YNAB Four Rules (Core Methodology)

### Rule 1: Give Every Dollar a Job
- Assign all available money to categories until nothing left
- No money sits unassigned
- Every dollar has a purpose before it's spent

### Rule 2: Embrace Your True Expenses
- Break large, infrequent expenses into monthly amounts
- Example: $1,200 annual insurance = $100/month category
- Prepare for predictable "unexpected" expenses

### Rule 3: Roll with the Punches
- When overspending happens, adjust other categories
- Budget is flexible, not restrictive
- Move money between categories as needed

### Rule 4: Age Your Money
- Goal: Spend money earned 30+ days ago
- Creates buffer between earning and spending
- Reduces financial stress and paycheck-to-paycheck cycle

## Common YNAB Challenges & Solutions
