# Increase Soluble Fiber Intake Project

**Status**: Active
**Start Date**: 2025-11-30
**Priority**: High
**Project Type**: Health improvement, cholesterol management
**Goal**: Lower LDL cholesterol by increasing soluble fiber consumption

## Project Overview

Increase soluble fiber intake to help reduce LDL cholesterol naturally. Soluble fiber binds to cholesterol in the digestive system and helps remove it from the body. Focus on incorporating beans, oats, apples, oranges, and other high-soluble-fiber foods into daily diet.

## Target Guidelines

### Recommended Soluble Fiber Intake
- **General recommendation**: 25-30g total fiber per day (for men)
- **Soluble fiber target**: 10-25g per day for cholesterol reduction
- **Therapeutic dose**: 10-15g soluble fiber per day shows significant LDL reduction
- **Current intake**: (To be baselined)

### Initial Goal
- [ ] Track current fiber intake for one week (baseline)
- [ ] Gradually increase to 10-15g soluble fiber per day
- [ ] Aim for 25-30g total fiber per day
- [ ] Avoid digestive discomfort by increasing gradually

## High Soluble Fiber Foods to Add

### Oats & Oat Products (TOP PRIORITY)
- **Oatmeal**: 2g soluble fiber per cup (cooked)
- **Oat bran**: 2-3g soluble fiber per 1/3 cup (raw)

## Tracking Methods

### Daily Tracking
- [ ] Use food tracking app with fiber breakdown
- [ ] Log all high-fiber foods
- [ ] Distinguish soluble vs total fiber when possible
- [ ] Track water intake (important with increased fiber)

### Weekly Review
- [ ] Calculate average daily soluble fiber
- [ ] Note which foods you enjoyed
- [ ] Identify barriers or challenges
- [ ] Plan next week's meals

### Digestive Monitoring
- [ ] Note any bloating or gas (normal initially)
- [ ] Ensure adequate water intake (64+ oz daily)
- [ ] Increase fiber gradually if discomfort occurs
- [ ] Consider probiotics if needed

## Important Considerations

### Increase Gradually
- **Why**: Sudden increase can cause gas, bloating, cramping
- **How**: Add 2-3g soluble fiber every few days
- **Timeline**: Reach target over 4-6 weeks, not overnight

### Drink More Water
- **Why**: Fiber absorbs water, needs it to work properly
- **How much**: 64-80 oz per day minimum
- **Timing**: Drink water with meals and throughout day

### Digestive Adaptation
- **Normal**: Some initial gas/bloating as gut bacteria adjust
- **Usually resolves**: Within 2-4 weeks
- **If persistent**: Scale back temporarily, then increase slower

## Success Metrics

### Process Goals
- [ ] Track fiber intake for 4 consecutive weeks
- [ ] Eat oatmeal 5+ days per week
- [ ] Include beans in meals 4-5 days per week
- [ ] Eat 1-2 apples or oranges daily
- [ ] Drink 64+ oz water daily

### Outcome Goals
- [ ] Reach 10-15g soluble fiber per day consistently
- [ ] Reduce LDL cholesterol by 5-10% (measure in 3-6 months)
- [ ] Maintain increased fiber intake for 3+ months
- [ ] Experience improved digestion
- [ ] Feel more satisfied/full from meals

## Expected Cholesterol Impact

### Research Shows:
- **5-10g soluble fiber daily**: Can reduce LDL by 3-5%
- **10-15g soluble fiber daily**: Can reduce LDL by 5-10%
- **Timeline**: Noticeable reduction in 4-6 weeks
- **Maximum benefit**: Usually seen at 3-6 months

### Example:
- Starting LDL: 160 mg/dL
- With 10-15g soluble fiber daily: 152-144 mg/dL
- Additional benefit when combined with reduced saturated fat

## Recipe Ideas

### Easy Bean Recipes
1. **Bean Salad**: Black beans, corn, tomatoes, lime, cilantro
2. **Bean Tacos**: Seasoned black beans, vegetables, salsa
3. **Hummus**: Homemade from chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon
