## Status: In Use at School - Usage Discrepancy Investigation

### 11/4/2025 - Usage Pattern Discrepancy Identified
**Current Situation:**
- ✅ **Teddy has everything he needs** - All equipment working properly
- ✅ **Teddy reports regular use** - States he's using the FM unit regularly
- ⚠️ **Teacher observations differ** - Teachers report not seeing regular use
- 🤔 **Two possible explanations:**
  1. Teddy may not be using it as regularly as he reports
  2. Teddy may be using it discreetly and teachers aren't noticing

**Action Plan:**
- 📅 **Tonight (11/4)**: Katie and John connecting with Teddy to discuss FM unit usage
- 📅 **Tomorrow morning (11/5)**: Meeting with learning specialist Min to discuss and align on expectations
- 📅 **2-4 weeks from resolution**: Follow-up check-in with Teddy and Min

**Overall Status:** System functioning well, usage patterns need clarification and alignment

### 10/02/2025 - School Implementation Complete
