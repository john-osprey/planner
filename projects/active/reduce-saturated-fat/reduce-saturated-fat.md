# Reduce Saturated Fat Intake Project

**Status**: Active
**Start Date**: 2025-11-30
**Priority**: High
**Project Type**: Health improvement, cholesterol management
**Goal**: Lower LDL cholesterol through reduced saturated fat consumption

## Project Overview

Reduce saturated fat intake to improve cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular health. Focus on identifying high saturated fat foods currently consumed and replacing them with healthier alternatives.

## Target Guidelines

### Recommended Saturated Fat Limits
- **American Heart Association**: <7% of total daily calories
- **For 2000 calorie diet**: <15-16 grams saturated fat per day
- **For 2500 calorie diet**: <19-20 grams saturated fat per day
- **Current intake**: (To be baselined)

### Initial Goal
- [ ] Track current saturated fat intake for one week (baseline)
- [ ] Reduce saturated fat intake by 25-30% from baseline
- [ ] Aim for <13g saturated fat per day (aggressive target)

## Action Plan

### Week 1-2: Assessment Phase
- [ ] Track all food intake for 7 days
- [ ] Calculate average daily saturated fat intake
- [ ] Identify top 5 sources of saturated fat in current diet
- [ ] Review food labels for saturated fat content
- [ ] Establish baseline measurement

### Week 3-4: Initial Reduction
- [ ] Eliminate or reduce #1 saturated fat source
- [ ] Implement 3-5 breakfast/lunch swaps
- [ ] Start reading nutrition labels consistently
- [ ] Plan meals for week in advance
- [ ] Track saturated fat intake daily

### Week 5-8: Sustained Change
- [ ] Eliminate or reduce top 3 saturated fat sources
- [ ] Implement dinner swaps
- [ ] Develop go-to low saturated fat meals
- [ ] Track progress on cholesterol (if lab work scheduled)
- [ ] Refine and adjust based on what's working

### Month 3+: Maintenance
- [ ] Maintain reduced saturated fat intake
- [ ] Continue tracking periodically
- [ ] Get cholesterol rechecked (3-6 months)
- [ ] Adjust based on lab results
- [ ] Make sustainable long-term habits

## Tracking Methods

### Daily Tracking
- [ ] Use food tracking app (MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, LoseIt)
- [ ] Log all meals and check saturated fat content
- [ ] Aim for daily saturated fat goal
- [ ] Note foods that are unexpectedly high in saturated fat

### Weekly Review
- [ ] Calculate average daily saturated fat for week
- [ ] Identify patterns or problem areas
- [ ] Plan swaps for following week
- [ ] Celebrate successes

### Monthly Assessment
- [ ] Review monthly average saturated fat intake
- [ ] Compare to baseline
- [ ] Identify remaining high saturated fat foods
- [ ] Adjust strategy as needed

## Label Reading Guidelines

**Saturated Fat Per Serving:**
- **Low**: <1g per serving
- **Moderate**: 1-3g per serving
- **High**: >3g per serving (limit or avoid)

**Check for:**
- Serving size (often smaller than you think)
- Total servings per package
- Saturated fat grams AND % Daily Value
- Ingredients list (look for: butter, cream, coconut oil, palm oil)

## Restaurant & Eating Out Strategies

### General Rules
- Choose grilled, baked, or broiled instead of fried
- Ask for dressings and sauces on the side
- Request no butter on vegetables or bread
- Choose fish or chicken over red meat
- Skip the cheese or ask for reduced amount
- Choose tomato-based sauces over cream-based

### Questions to Ask
- "Can this be prepared without butter?"
- "Do you have olive oil instead of butter?"
- "Can I substitute vegetables for fries?"
- "What's the leanest protein option?"

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Family meals with high saturated fat
**Solution**: Make personal modifications (skip cheese, use less meat, add vegetables)

### Challenge: Eating out frequently
**Solution**: Research restaurant menus in advance, ask for modifications, choose wisely

### Challenge: Habit of using butter/cheese
**Solution**: Keep olive oil easily accessible, measure portions, gradually reduce amounts

### Challenge: Cravings for high-fat foods
**Solution**: Allow small portions occasionally, find healthier alternatives, wait 10 minutes

### Challenge: Convenience foods are high in saturated fat
**Solution**: Meal prep on weekends, keep healthy snacks ready, plan ahead

## Medical Monitoring

### Baseline Labs (if not done recently)
- [ ] Get lipid panel: Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides
- [ ] Record baseline values
- [ ] Set target LDL goal with doctor

### Follow-up Labs
- [ ] Recheck lipid panel in 3 months
- [ ] Recheck again at 6 months if needed
- [ ] Track progress toward LDL goal
- [ ] Adjust diet further if needed

### Doctor Consultation
- [ ] Discuss cholesterol results with doctor
- [ ] Review saturated fat reduction plan
- [ ] Ask about statin medication if diet alone insufficient
- [ ] Get personalized LDL target
