## Goal

Reduce saturated fat intake to <13-15g per day to lower LDL cholesterol

## Key Strategies

1. **Track baseline** - Log food for 1 week to establish current intake
2. **Swap dairy** - Whole milk → skim, regular cheese → low-fat
3. **Reduce red meat** - Limit to 1-2x/month, choose fish/chicken

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Download food tracking app (MyFitnessPal)
